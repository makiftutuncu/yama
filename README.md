# yama `📦 → 🎁`

yama is short for _**Y**et **A**nother **M**utation **Ab**straction_. Coincidentally, it means "patch" in Turkish.

## Development

* Run `./gradlew clean` to clean all build outputs.
* Run `./gradlew build` to only build the application.
* Run `./gradlew check` to run all checks, including tests.

## Limitations

* Cannot work with `private` marked `PatchData` types
